# Introduction to Python

Python is a general-purpose programming language that is suitable for a wide variety of core tasks in the digital humanities. Learning Python fundamentals is a gateway to analyzing data, creating visualizations, composing interactive websites, scraping the internet, and engaging in distant reading of texts.

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

- Understand what Python is and, in general terms, what it can do.
- Run Python programs, both by interacting directly with the interpreter and by preparing and running scripts.
- Distinguish among five core data types—integers, floats, strings, booleans, and lists.
- Become familiar with core programming concepts, including variables, loops, and conditionals.
- Engage with error output and use the internet and documentation to independently research language features.
- Learn how to find and import code from external sources to solve more complex problems.
