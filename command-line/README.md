# Introduction to the Command Line

Today we will be getting comfortable working in the command line tool in DH Box. Typically, to access command line interface, you would use the Terminal application in Mac OS or the Bash Shell in Windows. The advantage of doing our work this week in DH Box is that within DH Box you cannot accidentally delete or overwrite files or otherwise endanger the file system of your personal computer. The power of the command line to execute permanent action is one of its assets, but working in DH Box helps to get started in a space with more room for error.

By this point in our academic careers, most of us have figured out some ways we like to interact with computers. Whether that involves avoiding them as much as possible or constantly testing new software, we likely have some ideas about how we feel comfortable getting things done. How would you show a person who had never seen a computer, say [Kimmy Schmidt](https://youtu.be/LIdFa1qLgNQ) or [Brendan Fraser in *Blast from the Past*](https://youtu.be/Xq29uTtKW4M), how to *do* something on your computer? 

Many of us would explain what a screen and a cursor are, and then show how to point and click on icons. This approach relies on a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced "gooey!"). 

Today we're going to explore another way to make your computer do things: through the command line. While this new technique can seem intimidating if you haven't used text-based interfaces before, luckily, you can use 90% of the functionality of the command line by becoming comfortable with a very small set of the most common commands.

In this session, we'll learn those common commands by exploring and manipulating a simple data set. By the end of the session, you'll be able to navigate your computer, create and manipulate files, and transform text-based data using only the command line.
